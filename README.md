GlosTrainer
===========

Initial version of a word learning application for English-speaking learners of 
the Swedish language, written in Java SE 1.8.

It's a rewritten version of an application that I wrote as a final project for a
course in C#. The Java version is platform-independent and the code follows the 
MVC model to look more structured.

** How to run the application: ** 
- Make sure you have Java 1.8 or higher installed.
- Download, extract and run GlosTrainer.zip, then double-click on GlosTrainer.jar to run
- The lib folder needs to be in the same folder as GlosTrainer.jar to make the icons visible

** GlosTrainer features: **
* a simple, user-friendly GUI for adding, editing, deleting, filtering and sorting 
words. Optional word forms for some word classes, such as definitive and plural
forms for nouns are available. Thus user can add own notes to the word entries.
* filtering of the word table. This can be made by exact or partial matches, as 
well as being limited to  only dictionary forms of words, or expanded to all forms 
of words.  
* supports importing and exporting word lists to/from files.
